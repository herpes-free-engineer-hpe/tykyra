This is a Matlab script to solve the ODEs for virus-laden evaporating sputum droplet settling by gravity.

Evaporation model is that of Abramzon-Sirignano (1989)
Saliva model is based on Mikhailov et al. (2003)
And the exponential virus decay for SARS-CoV-2 based on the results from van Doremalen et al. (2020)
